                <div class="article-text">The chemical space of potentially “drug-like,” pharmacologically active molecules is huge, estimated at 10^60. Evaluating even the restricted chemical space around a particular 
                    molecular scaffold can be time and resource-intensive. Machine learning approaches aiming to learn relationships between molecules and the property in question can dramatically accelerate the screening 
                    process by recognizing abstract and higher-order molecular characteristics in already screened molecules associated with their bioactivity. This allows for better selectivity in future experiments, giving researchers 
                    information on which molecules are most and least likely to have the desired properties.</div>

                <div class="article-text">Models, however, are as good as the data they were trained on. An experienced dendrologist may be able to classify almost all known tree species in the world, and a paleontologist 
                    could determine heaps of information from a dinosaur’s collarbone. Switch their roles and neither would have a clue at the task before them. ML models suffer from the same problem in cases where data they 
                    encounter in wild, real-world use, differ fundamentally from the data they were trained on, leading potentially to inaccurate and misleading predictions.</div>

                <div class="article-text">In the chemical space, this problem risks manifesting itself when a model is used to predict properties for molecules in an unfamiliar chemical space. For 
                    example, medicinal chemists often center work around a molecular scaffold, a foundational molecular structure with desirable properties, testing variations with new R groups and sidechains.

                <div class="article-text">We use the BACE dataset of 1,513 inhibitors of human β-secretase 1 in our testing, and we’ll be using a regression model. With a naive split, the dataset is randomly divided into 
                    a train subset and a test subset. This results in a similar distribution of features and properties across both sets, and is effective in testing model performance on <i>familiar</i> data. Figure 3 depicts this similarity. 
                    To test model performance on <i>unfamiliar</i> data, we artificially split the dataset so that the test set differs from the train set.</div>

                <div class="article-text">For both models, prediction accuracy is worse under scaffold splitting, confirming the effectiveness of the split. We expect lower accuracy because the model has never seen these types of molecules before, unlike under the random split.</div>
                <div class="article-text">We observe that the baseline model performs poorly on the scaffold split data, with a root mean square error (RMSE) of more than 2.5 times that of the random split. The Oloren ensemble model performs only slightly worse than the random split, and its RMSE (0.64) is 
                    almost equal to the baseline model’s RMSE on the random split (0.61). You’ll observe that with the Oloren ensemble model there are clusters of predicted values around 7.5 and below 7, indicating (A) that this model could be used to filter out molecule candidates with low bioactivity and 
                    (B) that classification would be a more appropriate approach for this dataset. The concept of AI model translation to decision making during the drug discovery process and strategy for model design will be explored in future posts.</div>
                <div class="article-text">We can conclude that for the BACE dataset, Oloren’s ensemble model generalizes well to unfamiliar chemical spaces and provides superior performance relative to the baseline model. </div>
                <div class="article-text">Model generalizability is an important feature to have and understand during the ML-assisted drug screening process. A generalizable model will be able to predict with high confidence the properties of molecules it 
                    has never seen before, reducing the need and pressure to perform extensive manual assays each time a new chemical class is to be tested. Generalizable models can predict across multiple different scaffolds and molecule types without prior screening, 
                    while a non-generalizable model requires manual generation of data for a new molecule class if accurate predictions are desired.</div>
